# Bikeshare Analysis

This project is part of the _Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree_. 
It involves analyzing **bikeshare data** from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The bikeshare.py script allows users to interactively explore and analyze the data to gain insights into bike usage patterns.

## Features

 * Interactive user interface: The script prompts the user to select a city and specify filters for analyzing the data.
 * Data exploration: Users can view statistics such as popular travel times, common stations, trip durations, and user demographics.
* Filter options: The script provides options to filter data by month and day of the week, allowing users to focus on specific time periods.
* Raw data display: Users have the option to view the raw data for individual trips.

If you use VSC check VSC python version first and change to equivalent Python version. Use the Python: Select Interpreter (View -> Command Palette).

Clone this repository and run the script using the following command:

```python bikeshare.py```

Follow the prompts to interact with the data and explore different aspects of bikeshare usage.

## Depedencies

The bikeshare.py script requires the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* datetime

Make sure you have these libraries installed before running the script.
